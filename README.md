# Object-oriented-project
Project created for object-oriented programming course, winter 2020.


The project was to create an API-layer program for managing a given business while following the guidelines of object-oriented programming. 
I focused on creating a program that can easily manage connections between different types of data - in this case animals, exhibits and employees of a zoo. 
While outside the scope of the course, additional features such as a simple system for saving and loading data or adding more data for any of the classes would be simple.
